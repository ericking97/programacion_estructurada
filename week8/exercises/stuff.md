Hi Almudena.

I'm doing great today how about you?

That's nice to hear, are you located on Merida?

<!-- That's nice to hear, are you located in Merida? -->

I consider myself a backend developer, I've been working with Node.js for about 4 years now, I also have experience
working with Python and a growing interest in Golang.

I know how AWS works, I use Ec2 that's an instance

I wanted to distance myself from the work environment,

I do understand that you probably require advanced English for this position, sadly I'm an insecure dumb fuck
who chokes hard when asked questions I haven't thought.

Maybe I should be more confident since I regularly listen to English broadcast basically 24/7, all the content
I consume online is in English, all the readings I do are in English so why am I so unsecure.
